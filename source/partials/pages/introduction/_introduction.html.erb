<p>As the Vibes platform continues to become an increasingly more robust, feature-rich application for mobile marketers, it has become a challenge to unify disparate product lines and functionality into a unified marketing software experience. The Vibes platform styleguide provides a single design language and reference point from which designers and developers can draw consistent elements. The styleguide will provide common elements and styles, as well as user experience patterns.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the styleguide, please reach out to the <a href="mailto:produx@vibes.com">Vibes Product Team</a>.</p>
